# Changelog

## [3.2.1][] - 2019-06-20
- Tweak the built-in US SSN regex to work better on large input by removing the optional delimters (the digits regex will already cover this situation)

## [3.2.0][] - 2019-05-21
- Add enhancement to automatically split Google DLP input that is too large into smaller batches. This can be disabled with the `disableAutoBatchWhenContentSizeExceedsLimit` option. 
 
## [3.1.0][] - 2019-05-04
- BREAKING: rename `replacementValue` param of built-in redaction config to `replaceWith` for consistency
 
## [3.0.2][] - 2019-05-04
- fix parameter typo in docs (`enable` -> `enabled`)
- fix `TypeError` when attempting to disable built-in redactors

## [3.0.1][] - 2019-04-29
- Fix `Cannot find module './well-known-names.json'` error by making sure the file gets properly packaged

## [3.0.0][] - 2019-04-21
 
- This version is an almost complete rewrite from prior versions and **breaks** the prior API contract. In summary the changes are:
- Library is now written in TypeScript
- Introduces seperate API for sync and async redaction via seperate `SyncRedactor` and `AsyncRedactor` classes and seperate `.redact` and `.redactAsync` methods.
- **Important Breaking Change:** The `redact` and `redactSync` methods now always expect a `string`. Passing anything else causes undefined behaviour and *may* cause an exception. Prior versions of the library used to simply return the original value "untouched" if it wasn't a `string`.
- Google Cloud DLP redaction is now a seperate redaction class that has to be explicitly imported and instantiated (`new GoogleDLPRedactor()`)
  in order to use it.
- Google Cloud DLP redaction does not have an implicit, hard-coded 5000ms timeout anymore. If you want to set a timeout for DLP calls you have to implement it yourself. In case you're using `bluebird` as promise library consider using `.timeout`.
